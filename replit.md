## User Preferences

### Development Guidelines
- Always use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow shadcn/ui design system patterns
- Use TanStack Query for API state management
- Implement proper data-testid attributes for all interactive elements
- Follow GHG Protocol 2025 standards for emission calculations
- Use Google Routes API for accurate travel distance calculations
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states

### API Key Management
The application requires the following API keys to be configured as Replit secrets:
- `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY`: For Google Routes API and Places API access
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI co-pilot functionality

## Setup Instructions

### Google Routes API Setup
1. Get a Google Cloud API key with the following APIs enabled:
   - Routes API
   - Places API (Text Search)
2. Add the API key to Replit secrets as `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY`

### Database Setup
Run the following command to push schema changes to the database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### Running the Application
The application runs both frontend and backend on port 5000:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Key Features

### Smart Journey Planning
- Search for any location using Google Places API
- Calculate exact distances using Google Routes API
- Automatic emission calculations for different vehicle types
- Support for round trips and multi-stop journeys
- Real-time CO2e emission estimates

### Transportation Modes Supported
- **Cars**: Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric (with different emission factors)
- **Flights**: Domestic and International (with appropriate factors)
- **Public Transport**: Trains, Buses
- **Other**: Motorcycles with specific emission factors

### Integration with Carbon Calculator
- Seamless integration with existing Scope 3 calculations
- Toggle between manual input and smart journey planning
- Auto-population of business travel distances
- Visual summary of journey emissions in calculation results

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Google Routes API service implementation completed
